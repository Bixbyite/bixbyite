<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>This project was vizualised several years ago when my father brought home a box filled with analog cameras and photography equipment. My mother saw no use to them and her immediate response was to attempt to throw the wholen the trash bin. Whilst I looked at this trash with a sense of wonder; those wore materials, a part of history and it was my family's history.</p>
