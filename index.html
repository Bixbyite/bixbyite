  <h2>The Story</h2><div></div>
<p>This project was vizualised several years ago when my father brought home a box filled with analog cameras and photography equipment.<br>
  My mother saw no use to them and her immediate response was to attempt to throw the whole box the trash bin.<br>
  Whilst I looked at this trash with a sense of wonder; those wore materials, a part of history and it was my family's history. <br>
  I then restored the old cameras and started to rescue everything that my mother labeled as trash to give them new life.<br> 
  I scanned the old photos that she had no time to rip apart and brought the old Nikon FM2 camera to usefulness.<br> 
  That is when I decided I had to share all of this; the art and the history.</p>
